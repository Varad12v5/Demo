ğŸ”€ Git Branching Operations
âœ… 1. Create a New Branch

git branch feature-1
ğŸ“Œ Creates a new branch named feature-1 based on your current branch (usually main or master).

âœ… 2. Switch to a Branch

git checkout feature-1
ğŸ“Œ Switches to the branch feature-1.

Or use the modern way:

git switch feature-1

âœ… 3. Create & Switch in One Command

git checkout -b feature-2
ğŸ“Œ Creates a new branch feature-2 and switches to it immediately.

Or:

git switch -c feature-2|

âœ… 4. List All Branches

git branch
ğŸ“Œ Lists all local branches. The current branch is marked with *.

âœ… 5. Rename a Branch

git branch -m old-name new-name
ğŸ“Œ Renames the branch old-name to new-name.

âœ… 6. Merge a Branch into Current Branch

git checkout main
git merge feature-1
ğŸ“Œ Merges changes from feature-1 into main.

If there are conflicts, Git will notify you to resolve them manually.

âœ… 7. Delete a Branch

git branch -d feature-1
ğŸ“Œ Deletes the branch feature-1 (only if itâ€™s already merged).

To force delete:

git branch -D feature-1
âœ… 8. Push a Branch to GitHub

git push origin feature-1

âœ… 9. Pull a Remote Branch Locally

git fetch origin
git checkout -b feature-1 origin/feature-1

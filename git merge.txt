ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step Git Branch Merging Example
âœ… Step 1: Initialize a Git Repository

mkdir git-merge-demo
cd git-merge-demo
git init

âœ… Step 2: Create a File and Make First Commit
echo "This is the main branch." > file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit on main"

âœ… Step 3: Create and Switch to Feature Branch
git checkout -b feature-branch

âœ… Step 4: Modify File in Feature Branch

echo "Feature branch adds this line." >> file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Updated file.txt in feature branch"

âœ… Step 5: Switch Back to main Branch
git checkout main

âœ… Step 6: Merge the Feature Branch into Main

git merge feature-branch
